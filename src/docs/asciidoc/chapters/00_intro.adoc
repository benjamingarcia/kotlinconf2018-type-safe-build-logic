== Introduction

=== Declarative builds with custom models

[source,kotlin]
----
myCustomSourceGenerator {
    enable("Kotlin", "Java")
}

integrationTests {
    db {
        jdbcUrl = "…"
    }
    legacy { }
}
----

[%step]
* Declarative elements describe the “what”
* The underlying logic creates the “how”
* Groovy provided an extensible DSL language

=== Naivety around tooling support

[%step]
* Dynamicity + Metaprogramming ==> Tooling is difficult
* Negative impact was underestimated
[%step]
** Hard to configure 
** Hard to refactor 
* Cause for a lot of non-idiomatic Gradle build scripts

=== Kotlin is the missing link
