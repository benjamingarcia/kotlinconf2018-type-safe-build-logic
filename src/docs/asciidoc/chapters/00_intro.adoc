== Introduction

=== Declarative builds with custom models

[source,kotlin]
----
myCustomSourceGenerator {
    enable("Kotlin", "Java")
}

integrationTests {
    db {
        jdbcUrl = "…"
    }
    legacy {
    }
}
----

[%step]
* Declarative elements describe the “what”
* The underlying logic creates the “how”
* Groovy provided an extensible DSL language

=== Lack of tooling support

[%step]
* Hoped that ecosystem will eventually provide a solution
* Underestimated the negative impact
[%step]
** Models hard to configure for developers
** Models hard to refactor and evolve for build authors
* A lot of non-idiomatic Gradle code because of this

=== Kotlin is the missing link
