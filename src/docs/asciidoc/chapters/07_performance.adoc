* In comparison with the Gradle Groovy DSL


=== Gradle Kotlin DSL vs. Groovy DSL

*when nothing has changed*

[%step]
* Similar performance characteristics for most builds
* ~100ms gap on a large build with 500 sub projects
* ~2ms hit per project in that scenario, ymmv

=== Gradle Kotlin DSL vs. Groovy DSL

*first use, or, change in `buildSrc`*

[%step]
* Slower in certain scenarios
[%step]
** first use (checkout, pulling changes, switching branches)
** changes in the build logic, the worse being changing `buildSrc`
* We are talking about ~3.5 times slower at the moment
* ~1min gap on a large build with 500 sub projects
* ~120ms per project in that scenario, ymmv
* *Script compilation is the main bottleneck*



=== Gradle Build Cache

[.lead]
*to the rescue*

[%step]
* Script compilation can be cached in a Gradle Build Cache
* Simply enable it
** `org.gradle.caching=true` in your `gradle.properties`
** or use `--build-cache` on the command line

=== Gradle Build Cache

[%step]
* Local and remote caches
* In general, build cache helps with your overall build performance
** link:https://guides.gradle.org/using-build-cache/[guides.gradle.org/using-build-cache]
* Gradle provides a Docker image for a link:https://hub.docker.com/r/gradle/build-cache-node/[build cache node]
* Pair it with Gradle Enterprise to get
** replication, monitoring, node management etc...

=== Performance opportunities

[%step]
* Compilation avoidance
* Parallel script compilation
* Faster Kotlin compilation
* Targeted optimizations

=== General performance advice

[%hardbreaks]
*Configuring your build when nothing has changed takes*
*more than a second?*
