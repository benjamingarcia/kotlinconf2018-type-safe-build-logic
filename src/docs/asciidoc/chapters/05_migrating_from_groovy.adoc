=== What benefits?

[%step]
- Type-safety
- Discoverability
- Documentation and navigation
- Refactorings


=== Shared functions

[%step]
* Just like shared declarations (e.g. dependencies)
* Don't use extra properties
* Move them to `buildSrc`
* Get IDE support


=== Interoperability

[%step]
* Gradle Plugins may
** expose untyped Groovy `Closure` taking functions
** rely on more Groovy dynamism
* e.g. Dokka required the use of `delegateClosureOf<T> {}`
** link:https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/pull/358[existing fix] will go in the next release

=== Interoperability

[%step]
* `closureOf<T> {}` and `delegateClosureOf<T> {}`
* `withGroovyBuilder {}`
* `apply(from = "some-groovy-script.gradle")`
* Covered in detail in the Gradle user manual
** link:https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html[docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html]


=== Migration strategies

[%step]
* Kotlin and Groovy build logic can coexist
** mechanical step by step migration possible
** migrating doesn't block your team
* Prepare your build to make it easier to migrate
* by making your Groovy scripts closer to Kotlin
** unify quotes, disambiguate properties/functions  ...
* by applying Gradle fundamentals and best practices
** use `buildSrc` and `plugins {}` etc...
* Let Kotlin logic drive Groovy logic
** not the other way around


=== Resources for migration

[%step]
* Migration guide available at link:https://guides.gradle.org/[guides.gradle.org]
* Gradle user manual available at link:{user-manual}[docs.gradle.org]
** both Groovy/Kotlin snippets
** best place to learn how to do what with each DSL, and compare


=== Groovy and Kotlin samples

=== Script Plugins

[%step]
* A script plugin is a `.gradle(.kts)` script
* Applied from another one
** `apply(from = "some.gradle.kts")`
* Do not support the `plugins {}` block, yet
* Covered in detail in the Gradle user manual
** link:https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html[docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html]


=== Precompiled script plugins

[%step]
* Same as script plugins
* Compiled as part of a Kotlin source set
* Can be used in `buildSrc`
* Can be used in binary plugins
* Covered in detail in the Gradle user manual
** link:https://docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html[docs.gradle.org/5.0-milestone-1/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html]
