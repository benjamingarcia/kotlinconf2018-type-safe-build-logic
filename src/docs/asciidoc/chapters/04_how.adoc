== What makes all this possible?

=== The Gradle build model

[%step]
* Gradle Plugins contribute reusable and configurable models
* This is a dynamic model
* The Gradle Kotlin DSL provides a static view over that model

=== `.kt` vs `.kts` vs `.gradle.kts`

[%step]
* `.kt` files contain plain Kotlin code
** assumed to be compiled by the kotlin compiler
* `.kts` files contain Kotlin code
** assumed to be executed by the kotlin scripting support
* `.gradle.kts` files contain Kotlin code
** assumed to be hosted by Gradle

=== `.gradle.kts`

[%step]
* Gradle Kotlin DSL in the classpath
* Script compilation dependencies coming from Gradle
* Implicit imports
* Custom tailored IDE script editor support

=== IDE support

=== The Gradle Kotlin DSL sugar

[%step]
* Kotlin friendly extensions of the Gradle API
** `KClass<T>`, `reified<T>()`
** Delegated properties for Gradle properties and collections
* Dynamically generated Kotlin extensions
** calculated right before evaluating the script body
** for model elements contributed by plugins (configurations, extensions, tasks etc...)
* Interoperability utilities
// * Configuration avoidance by default
